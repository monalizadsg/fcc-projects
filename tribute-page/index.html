              “If you’re not stubborn, you’ll give up on experiments too soon.
              And if you’re not flexible, you’ll pound your head against the
              wall and you won’t see a different solution to a problem you’re
              trying to solve.”

              “If you want to be inventive, you have to be willing to fail.”

            <blockquote>
              “What we need to do is always lean into the future; when the world
              changes around you and when it changes against you – what used to
              be a tail wind is now a head wind – you have to lean into that and
              figure out what to do because complaining isn’t a strategy.”
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              “If you double the number of experiments you do per year you’re
              going to double your inventiveness.”

            <blockquote>
              “I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the
              one thing I might regret is not trying.”
